## 🧾 Description

This project is submitted as part of **CS50 – Introduction to Computer Science**, offered by Harvard University.  
I’m **Muthuswamy Nadar**, a B.Sc-IT graduate and aspiring Data Scientist from Mumbai, India.

For my final project, I created a fully responsive **personal portfolio website** using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
